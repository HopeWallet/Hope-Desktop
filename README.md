# Introduction

The Hope Ethereum Wallet is a not-for-profit wallet built to support philanthropic and charitable cryptocurrencies. The wallet is a fully functional Ethereum wallet which allows for the transfer of Ether as well as any ERC20 token. Any user can simply create a wallet by importing a mnemonic passphrase, create a new one, or simply open their wallet with a Ledger or Trezor hardware wallet. 

# Mission

The primary goal of Hope is to help spread awareness and support for cryptocurrencies with an ultimately altruistic goal. The supported cryptocurrencies have extra smart contracts implemented in natively within the wallet to allow for a smooth user experience. Supported cryptocurrencies will continue to be supported throughout development unless the altruistic goals are breached.

As for the wallet itself, there will never be any mechanism, functionality, feature, or text component, which asks for, demands, or forces the user to hand over anything of monetary value. The Hope wallet is meant to support altruistic cryptocurrencies, so requesting for payment of any form would fundamentally be inconsistent with the message we are trying to promote. We are strong believers of cryptocurrency technology and the power it has to impact the world. We would like to support that fully and whole-heartedly by making a wallet to support these cryptocurrencies without any monetary gain.

# Supported Cryptocurrencies

In Hope, there are currently a small list of supported altruistic cryptocurrencies. 

## PRPS/DUBI

Purpose (PRPS) and Decentralized Universal Basic Income (DUBI) are cryptocurrencies created by popular internet philanthropist and charity activist, [Athene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachir_Boumaaza). The creator has a history of raising money for charity and awareness for serious worldwide issues. He has worked closely together with [Save the Children](https://www.savethechildren.org/us/about-us/media-and-news/ambassadors/athene) and has helped raise over [$24 million dollars](https://www.gamingforgood.net/c/about) for various charity projects.

Recently, Athene has set his goals more worldwide and ambitious. He has created PRPS and DUBI with the goal of providing Universal Basic Income in impoverished regions around the world. In a pilot program together with Save the Children, the tokens will first be used and distributed in small regions in an attempt to aid poverty. These pilot programs are estimated to begin in early 2019.

The integration within the wallet has to do with the ability to lock PRPS and receive DUBI. Users can lock their PRPS in a smart contract for 3, 6, or 12 months, and receive DUBI back as interest. More information on the tokens can be found on the [following document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gLmfsXtj2-wDaTj4IAwr0OCEo1f6Gmy9/view).
