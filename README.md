# Introduction

The Hope Ethereum Wallet is a not-for-profit wallet built to support philanthropic and charitable cryptocurrencies. The supported cryptocurrencies have extra smart contracts implemented in natively within the wallet to allow for a smooth user experience. The primary goal of Hope is to help spread awareness and support for cryptocurrencies with an ultimately altruistic goal. Supported cryptocurrencies will continue to be supported throughout development unless the altruistic goals are breached.
